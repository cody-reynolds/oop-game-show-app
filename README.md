# OOP Game Show App
This is a word game application utilizing object-oriented JavaScript. The user is given a virtual keyboard and a random phrase. The user guesses letters that are in the phrase. If five letters are selected that are not part of the phrase, the game ends.

Modifications to the app:

Changed h2 heading to read "Let's Play Phrase Hunter!"

Changed background colors of the app start, win, and lose screens:
- Win - #059115
- Lose - #750505
- Start - #4408a3

Changed background colors of the virtual keyboard to better represent correctly and incorrectly chosen letters:
- Chosen - #42a550
- Wrong - #f76464

Adjusted letter spacing in the active phrase from 15 to 20 pixels.

Updated start and lose scenarios to call on variable colors declared at the top of styles.css.
